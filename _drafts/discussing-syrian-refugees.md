I was on ABC 10 News to talk about Syrian Refugees:

> U.C. Davis law professor Karima Bennoune said families allowed in to the United States are put through an extensive background check. She said the one Paris attacker with a Syrian passport was almost certainly not a refugee, but from Europe like the other terrorists.

> "Only one of the suspected perpetrators that we now know of was carrying this allegedly fake Syrian passport and all of them may well have been sort of home-grown," Bennoune said. "We really have to step up and show generosity and courage and leadership while, indeed, taking the security issue seriously."
