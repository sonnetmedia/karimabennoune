BEFORE the recent French intervention in [Mali](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/mali/index.html?inline=nyt-geo) began, 412,000 people had already left their homes in the countryâ€™s north, fleeing [torture, summary executions, recruitment of child soldiers and sexual violence against women at the hands of fundamentalist militants](http://reliefweb.int/report/mali/report-secretary-general-situation-mali-s2012894). Late last year, in Algeria and southern Mali, I interviewed dozens of Malians from the north, including many who had recently fled. Their testimonies confirmed the horrors that radical Islamists, self-proclaimed warriors of God, have inflicted on their communities.
