>Today marks the 20th anniversary of the murder of Algerian journalist Saïd Mekbel. He was shot while eating near his office in Algiers on 3 December 1994.

> That morning, his newspaper, Le Matin, had carried what proved to be his own eulogy, a poetic polemic about the plight of journalists caught up in conflict.

> And, as Karima Bennoune writes in Open Democracy, the piece known as “Ce voleur qui” (This thief who) remains sadly topical today because of the number of journalists killed in recent times, including those murdered by Islamic State (Isis) this year.
