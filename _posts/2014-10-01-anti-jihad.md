>As the UN Security Council tackles the entity claiming to be “Islamic State,” and President Barack Obama invokes global Muslim responsibility, many ask whether people of Muslim heritage do enough to counter extremism.

>The fact is, away from the media spotlight, thousands wage daily battles in their own countries against what President Obama called a “network of death.”
