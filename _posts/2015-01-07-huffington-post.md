I was on [Huffington Post Live](http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/paris-shooting-charlie-hebdo/54ad381e78c90aae8a0004e1) today discussing the attacks in Paris.

I will be on MSNBC's The Rundown with Jose Diaz-Balart at 10:40 AM and on MSNBC's The Cycle sometime between 3 and 4 tomorrow to discuss the attack.
