![](/assets/img/el-khabar-forum-dec-2013.jpg) El Khabar, Algeria’s largest Arabophone newspaper, hosted a forum in Algiers on December 9 on _Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here: Untold Stories from the Fight against Muslim Fundamentalism_. The event was attended by family members of a number of individuals whose opposition to fundamentalism is described in the book, including family members of Amel Zenoune-Zouani, A law student murdered by extremists for continuing her studies, of those to whom the book is dedicated. Also in attendance were the heads of two of Algeria's major groups of victims of terrorism: Cherifa Kheddar, President of Djazairouna, and Adnane Bouchaib, President of Somoud, the collective of families of those who disappeared at the hands of the armed groups.

The forum drew widespread coverage in Algerian media, including an article in El Watan, the country’s leading Francophone newspaper,  which is available at the following link, and which described Professor Bennoune’s book as “precise” and “courageous,” and Praised Her For Not Allowing Algerian Victims Of Terrorism To Be Forgotten.
