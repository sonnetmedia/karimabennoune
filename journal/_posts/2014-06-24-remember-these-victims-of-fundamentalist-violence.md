Today is the 18th anniversary of the assassinations of the brother and sister of Algerian victims' rights advocate Cherifa Kheddar by an armed fundamentalist group in Blida, Algeria on June 24, 1996 during the "dark decade."   To commemorate this tragic anniversary, Cherifa sent out this picture of her grieving family, and of Leila and Mohamed Redha Kheddar, her sister and brother who were murdered 18 years ago today by the Armed Islamic Group.

Cherifa with other families founded Djazairouna, the Algerian Association of victims of Islamist terrorism, after these awful murders.  Djazairouna's slogan is worth remembering today:

For the duty of truth  
For the duty of memory  
For the duty of justice  

Please help remember these victims of fundamentalist violence.
