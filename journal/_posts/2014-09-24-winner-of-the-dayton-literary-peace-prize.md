I am pleased to announce that _Your Fatwa Does not Apply Here_ has won the Dayton Literary Peace Prize for nonfiction.

From the press release:

> Two books exploring the role that religion can play in spurring either endless conflict or potential peace – The Woman Who Lost Her Soul by Bob  Shacochis and Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here by Karima Bennoune – today were named the winners of the 2014 Dayton Literary Peace Prize for fiction and nonfiction, respectively…For the first time in the history of the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, women comprise four out of the five honorees, including author Louise Erdrich, who will receive the 2014 Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement.

> Inspired by the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords that ended the war in Bosnia, The Dayton Peace Prize is the only international literary peace prize awarded in the United States.

From the Judges' Statement

> Throughout, Bennoune displays a first rate literary sensibility, with finely detailed profiles that cast the reader deep into the point of view of her subjects. We receive necessary historical context, nuanced political analysis, brisk narrative, and just the right balance between the author’s subjectivity and writerly distance. Bennoune is acutely aware of the ethical problems inherent in literary representations and the particular ramifications of rendering her subjects in the midst of a global conflict where all sides employ stereotype for the sake of advancing their agendas. At all costs, she wants to avoid victimizing those who’ve already been victimized.
