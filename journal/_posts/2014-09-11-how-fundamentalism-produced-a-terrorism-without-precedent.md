Dear Friends,

Open Democracy has just today, on the anniversary of 9/11, re-published the second and third parts of Mahfoud Bennoune's 1994 article "How Fundamentalism Produced a Terrorism without precedent".  Sadly, in light of events in Iraq and elsewhere, it has never been so relevant.  I hope this may be of interest, as it discusses both the history and the ideology of jihadism and fundamentalism.  It has been published with the new titles listed below.

Here are the links:
From 1990s Algeria to 9/11 and ISIS: Understanding the history of Homo Islamicus Fundamentalensis: part two
From 1990s Algeria to Iraq Today: Trampling Islam Underfoot in the name of jihad: part three

it goes with:
Algeria and Nigeria: Sharing the deadweight of human mindlessness: part one that was published back in May.
