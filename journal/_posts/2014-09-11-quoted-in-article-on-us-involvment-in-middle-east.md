I'm quoted in this article at the *Christian Science Monitor*: ["With Islamic State speech, Obama deepens US involvement in Middle East"](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2014/0911/With-Islamic-State-speech-Obama-deepens-US-involvement-in-Middle-East-video)

> The emphasis Obama placed on the humanitarian and ideological grounds for this intervention – he also said that “ISIL is not Muslim” and that “most of its victims are Muslims” – is a welcome surprise to some foreign policy analysts.

> “This is an ideological battle against Muslim fundamentalism and radical jihadism, so it’s not just important to fight the terrorists but to take on the fundamentalist ideology,” says Karima Bennoune, a professor of international law at the University of California, Davis, and an expert on Muslims’ confrontation with fundamentalism.
