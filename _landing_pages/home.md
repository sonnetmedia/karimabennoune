**Thursday January 26, 2017 marks the 20th anniversary of the killing of Algerian law student Amel Zenoune-Zouani who was then just 22 years old.  Amel was murdered by the Armed Islamic Group, the Daesh of the 1990s, for bravely refusing to give up her studies.  Her story is told in [_Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here_](/excerpt-from-your-fatwa-does-not-apply-here/) and in the final part of the TED talk "[When People of Muslim Heritage Challenge Fundamentalism.](https://www.ted.com/talks/karima_bennoune_the_side_of_terrorism_that_doesn_t_make_headlines)" Please help remember Amel, whose name means hope in Arabic, and stand with those continuing her struggle for education and against extremism around the world today.**
